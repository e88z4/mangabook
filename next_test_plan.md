# MangaBook Testing and Improvement Plan

## Immediate Actions

### 1. API Connectivity Issues
- Add timeouts to prevent hanging API requests
- Test with alternative chapter IDs and manga IDs
- Add retry mechanism specific to the chapter images endpoint
- Test with alternative API endpoints (if available)

### 2. Download Functionality
- Improve error handling for image downloads
- Add option to skip chapters with missing images
- Implement fallback to alternative scanlation groups if primary fails
- Verify raw file organization and structure

### 3. EPUB Generation
- Once download works, test conversion of downloaded chapters to EPUBs
- Verify image processing functionality
- Test Kobo-specific optimizations
- Check EPUB validation

## Future Testing

### 1. Batch Processing
- Test downloading multiple manga titles
- Verify queue functionality
- Test parallel downloads with different concurrency settings

### 2. History and Update Checking
- Test history recording of downloaded manga
- Verify update checking for new chapters
- Test incremental downloads

## Code Improvements

### 1. Error Handling
- Add graceful degradation for partial API failures
- Improve error messages and logging
- Add ability to resume interrupted downloads

### 2. Performance
- Optimize parallel downloads
- Improve caching mechanisms
- Reduce memory usage for large manga collections

### 3. User Experience
- Enhance progress reporting
- Add better error summaries
- Improve CLI interface for interactive mode
