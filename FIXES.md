# MangaBook Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: "Cannot access local variable 'e'" Error
- Fixed duplicate exception handlers in download_command in cli.py
- Fixed improper reference to exception variable in finally block in workflow.py

## Issue 2: Ungrouped Chapters Download Issue
- Fixed API response handling in api.py to normalize "none" key to "0" for ungrouped chapters
- Added special handling in downloader.py to check both "0" and "none" keys
- Confirmed that workflow.py correctly handles ungrouped chapters with volume_number == "0"

## Issue 3: History File Lifecycle (30 days)
- Confirmed that history.py already has a prune_history function that limits history to 30 days
- Confirmed that _save_history auto-prunes by default

## Issue 4: Updating Ungrouped Chapters with Overwrite
- Confirmed that the enhanced_builder.py correctly respects force_overwrite parameter
- Verified that CLI correctly handles --updates flag (shortcut for --ungrouped --force-overwrite)

## Issue 5: EPUB/KEPUB Generation Error
- Fixed error in EPUB/KEPUB generation by adding missing `_create_container_file` method to `EnhancedEPUBBuilder` class
- Error was: `'EnhancedKepubBuilder' object has no attribute '_create_container_file'`
- This method is responsible for creating the container.xml file required by the EPUB specification
- Verified fix by generating both regular volume and ungrouped chapter EPUB/KEPUB files successfully

## Tests Performed
- Tested ungrouped chapters download for Detective Conan
- Verified that API properly returns ungrouped chapters
- Confirmed normalization of "none" to "0" for ungrouped chapters
- Successfully generated EPUB/KEPUB files for both regular volumes and ungrouped chapters

## Next Steps
- Consider adding better error messages specific to ungrouped chapters
- Add documentation about the --updates flag for ongoing manga
- Fix minor validation warning about cover image file extension (.jpg for PNG files)
