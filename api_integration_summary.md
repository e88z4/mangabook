# MangaDex API Integration Summary

## Overview
The MangaDex API has been fully integrated into the MangaBook application with robust error handling and resource management. This document summarizes the changes made and the current state of the integration.

## Key Components

### API Module (`mangabook/api.py`)
- Contains a robust implementation of the MangaDex API wrapper
- Provides functions for manga search, chapter listing, and image retrieval
- Includes proper resource cleanup with `close()` method
- Added `close_global_api()` function to clean up global API instance

### Authentication Module (`mangabook/auth.py`)
- Handles authentication with MangaDex API
- Properly manages client sessions and connections
- Includes resource cleanup through `close()` method

### Workflow Module (`mangabook/workflow.py`)
- Main processing workflow for manga downloads
- Updated to ensure API and downloader resources are always closed, even when exceptions occur

### Downloader Module (`mangabook/downloader.py`)
- Handles downloading chapters and images
- `ChapterDownloader` tracks whether it created the API instance and closes it only if it's responsible
- `download_manga_volumes` already ensures proper resource cleanup

### CLI Module (`mangabook/cli.py`)
- Contains command-line interface functions
- All async CLI functions now properly close API resources

### Batch Module (`mangabook/batch.py`)
- Updated `batch_download` function to properly close API resources using try-finally

### Main Entry Point (`mangabook/__main__.py`)
- Ensures global API instance is closed on exit

## Testing

A test script `test_api_resource_cleanup.py` has been created to verify:
1. The API can successfully retrieve chapters for a manga
2. The API can retrieve manga volumes
3. The API can retrieve chapter images
4. All API resources are properly closed

## Key Changes

1. Added try-finally blocks to ensure API resources are always closed
2. Updated `batch_download` function to properly clean up API resources
3. Verified that all API-using functions properly close resources
4. Fixed resource warnings related to unclosed aiohttp sessions
5. Created test scripts to verify functionality and resource management

## Conclusion

The MangaDex API integration is now robust with proper error handling and resource management. All API functions have been tested and confirmed to work correctly, and all resources are properly closed when operations complete or if an error occurs.

## Next Steps

While the core API functionality is working correctly, there are a few optional improvements that could be made:

1. Add more detailed error messaging for network or API issues
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Add retry logic for transient errors
4. Consider implementing a context manager pattern for API usage
